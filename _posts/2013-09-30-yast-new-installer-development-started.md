# Yast "New Installer"

The Yast team started development of "_new Yast installer_". It actually won't
be a complete rewrite of the Yast installer, it will be rather a refreshing,
refactoring and adding some _enterprise_ features (for SLE12 - SUSE Linux
Enterprise 12). But of course, these enhancements will be also present in the
next openSUSE release (openSUSE-13.2, 13.1 is almost done).  

We just started public discussion about it, if you have some ideas about the
Yast installer just join the discussion at
[yast-devel](http://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/) mailing list.  

See [the
announcement](http://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/2013-09/msg00072.html), more
details will be published later, stay tuned...
