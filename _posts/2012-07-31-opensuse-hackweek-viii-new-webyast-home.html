<br />I noticed in the previous post that we want to have new cool home pages for WebYaST.<br /><br />We started at our Appliance Workshop and last week I continued as a Hackweek VIII project and the new page is now available here:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="http://webyast.github.com/webyast/">http://webyast.github.com/webyast/</a></span></div><br /><br />If you have any comments just post them here! Thank you for your feedback!
