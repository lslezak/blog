<h2>Yast "New Installer"</h2><br />The Yast team started development of "<i>new Yast installer</i>". It actually won't be a complete rewrite of the Yast installer, it will be rather a refreshing, refactoring and adding some <i>enterprise</i> features (for SLE12 - SUSE Linux Enterprise 12). But of course, these enhancements will be also present in the next openSUSE release (openSUSE-13.2, 13.1 is almost done). <br /><br />We just started public discussion about it, if you have some ideas about the Yast installer just join the discussion at <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/" target="_blank">yast-devel</a> mailing list.<br /><br />See <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/yast-devel/2013-09/msg00072.html" target="_blank">the announcement</a>, more details will be published later, stay tuned...
